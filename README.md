Meer Game
=========

The Flemish extreme right-wing party Vlaams Belang launched a very bad webgame where you need to attack muslims. This is my parody on it. Feel free to fork it and make it even better.

The original calls for less muslims, less immigration and less criminality. This one calls for more tolerance and more solidarity.

All game logic is in /src, resources can be found in /resources.

Not really sure what the licence is, because I just copied the original (http://www.minder-spel.com/). But as Banksy once said: 
*Fuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. Itâ€™s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.*
